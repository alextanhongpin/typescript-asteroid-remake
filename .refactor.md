# Using mixins/decorators

This will help to isolate functionality and extending them as needed.

```js
// Replace the {} with the Class you want to extend.
// type Constructor<T = {}> = new (...args: any[]) => T;
type Constructor<T = Drawable> = new (...args: any[]) => T;

function Invisibility<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    private isInvisible = false
    private timeout: any

    enterInvisibilityMode(duration: number) {
      this.isInvisible = true
      this.timeout && window.clearTimeout(this.timeout)
      this.timeout = window.setTimeout(() => {
        this.isInvisible = true
      }, duration)
    }
  }
}

function HealthBar<TBase extends Constructor>(Base: TBase) {
  return class extends Base {
    private hpX: number;
    private hpY: number;
    private hp: number;
    draw() {
      super.draw()
      console.log('draw health bar', this.x, this.y)
    }
  } 
}

interface Drawable {
  x: number
  y: number
  draw(): void
}

// This is however tying the functionality straight to the class,
// and therefore not preferable.
// @HealthBar
class Ship implements Drawable {
  x: number
  y: number
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this.x = x
    this.y = y
  }
  draw() {
    console.log('draw ship', this.x, this.y)
  }
}
// const ship = new Ship()
const ship = new (HealthBar(Ship))(5, 10)
ship.draw()
```

## Using Observer Patterns

Take a look into observer pattern, and fix the current implementation. The current implementation ties the behaviour to the class itself - the events should be registered externally.

## Naming

`movable/` folder could be renamed as `entity/` instead. Refactor them.

## Functional reactive programming

Take a look into how to utilize functional reactive programming instead.
